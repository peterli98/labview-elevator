# labview-elevator

Project Description:

This is a 3 level elevator with an emergency button.

Functionality:

1. There are switches on the physical demo which helps determining which floor you are currently on.

2. There are floor buttons you can press and it will take you to the floor of desire.

3. Once the emergency button is clicked the power gets killed and motor will stop moving.

4. There is also a physical limitation in the demo where the elevator won't be able to hit the ground, a bit unrealistic because of newton second law, but better than nothing
